## About Me
My name is [Ikenna Ude](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikenna-ude/ 'Linkedin Profile') and I'm a novice data scientist with a [certificate](https://eportfolio.mygreatlearning.com/ikenna-ude) from Texas McCombs School of Business in Data Science and Business Analytics. I believe that **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** are the next items on the path of industrial revolution and have a lot of good to offer in our world. 

Data exists all around us. Through data we can find patterns and educate ourselves to choose the best decisions. As an Automation professional, I am committed to looking for ways to use data analysis in the manufacturing industry to make better decisions.
